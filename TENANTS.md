# Tenants

Ecclesia Lucis affirms tenants rather than dogma.

Language is an imperfect tool for expressing meaning, and no written text can capture truth in its entirety. These tenants are not commandments or requirements of belief, but shared principles offered as guidance.

All tenants are provisional and open to revision.

No individual, council, or institution may claim exclusive authority to interpret, enforce, or speak on behalf of these tenants for others.

Honor and actively preserve the health of Earth’s interconnected ecosystems, recognizing them as the material foundation for all life.
