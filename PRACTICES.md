# Practices

This document describes optional practices associated with the Ecclesia Lucis Protocol.

Practices are not requirements.
They are tools, not tests.
They exist to help individuals and communities tend to light in themselves, in others, and in the material world.

No practice confers status.
No practice establishes authority.
Participation is voluntary, contextual, and revisable.

## 1. Reflection

Reflection is the practice of attending to one’s own experience with honesty and humility.

Suggested forms include:
- Quiet contemplation
- Journaling or written inquiry
- Dialogue with trusted others
- Study of philosophy, science, and history

The aim of reflection is not certainty, but clarity:
- What am I feeling?
- What am I avoiding?
- Where am I causing harm?
- Where am I capable of repair?

No interpretation is privileged over another.

## 2. Repair

Repair is the practice of addressing harm—internal, relational, or material—rather than denying or spiritualizing it.

Repair may include:
- Apology without expectation of forgiveness
- Reconciliation where safe and consensual
- Setting boundaries where reconciliation is not possible
- Therapy, counseling, or other professional support
- Restoring land, tools, or shared resources

Repair is considered a sacred act because it increases light by reducing unnecessary suffering.

## 3. Sustenance

Sustenance is the practice of supporting life directly and materially.

This includes:
- Growing food
- Sharing meals
- Feeding those in need without qualification or shame
- Supporting access to clean water, shelter, and care

Food grown or shared in excess of personal need is understood as light meant to circulate, not accumulate.

Sustenance is prioritized over symbolism.

## 4. Attention

Attention is the practice of choosing what one allows to shape the mind.

This may involve:
- Limiting exposure to media that thrives on fear, outrage, or dehumanization
- Cultivating curiosity rather than doom consumption
- Engaging with information deliberately, not compulsively

Attention is treated as a finite resource and a moral choice.

---

## 5. Rest

Rest is the practice of honoring physical and mental limits.

This includes:
- Sleep
- Stillness
- Time without productivity or performance
- Periodic withdrawal from noise, work, or obligation

Rest is not laziness.
It is maintenance of the light-bearing system.

---

## 6. Gathering (Optional)

Gathering refers to people choosing to be present with one another in shared reflection or service.

Gatherings may include:
- Conversation
- Silence
- Shared meals
- Collaborative labor (gardening, repair, service)

Gatherings are not sermons.
No individual speaks with spiritual authority over others.

---

## 7. Ceremonial Moments (Optional)

Certain moments in life—birth, partnership, death—benefit from intentional marking.

Ecclesia Lucis recognizes ceremonies as:
- Witnesses, not validations
- Expressions of meaning, not control
- Adaptable to culture, belief, and circumstance

Any ceremony must:
- Be consensual
- Avoid gender, familial, or hierarchical coercion
- Remain open to reinterpretation by those involved

No ceremony binds belief or allegiance.

---

## 8. Stewardship of Assets

Where land, property, or material assets are held in service of Ecclesia Lucis, they are treated as shared responsibilities rather than sources of personal power.

Stewardship practices include:
- Transparency in use and finances
- Prioritizing self-sustainability over extraction
- Using assets to support food growth, shelter, and community resilience

Accumulation without purpose is discouraged.
Sustainability without exploitation is the goal.

---

## Closing Note

Practices evolve.
They may be adopted, adapted, or abandoned.

What matters is not adherence, but intention:
to reduce darkness where possible,
and to increase light where it can be shared.
