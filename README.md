# Ecclesia Lucis Protocol

This repository describes an **open source spiritual protocol**, not an institution, hierarchy, or belief system that demands adherence.

Ecclesia Lucis exists as a shared framework for meaning, ethical reflection, and material care in a world experienced by many as fragmented, anxious, and dim. It is offered openly, without requirement, authority, or expectation of growth.

This protocol is:
- **Non-dogmatic** — no scripture, no infallible texts
- **Non-hierarchical** — no leaders who speak on behalf of others
- **Evidence-aware** — grounded in humility, inquiry, and revision
- **Forkable** — intended to be adapted, not enforced

If you find value here, you are free to practice, modify, or depart entirely.

No permission is required.
