# Covenant of Use

This protocol is offered freely and without expectation.

By engaging with Ecclesia Lucis materials, contributors and practitioners agree to the following principles:

- No claim of spiritual authority over others
- No requirement of belief, participation, or allegiance
- No monetization of legitimacy or access
- No coercion, shame, or fear-based persuasion
- No substitution for professional medical, legal, or mental health care

Interpretation is individual.  
Practice is voluntary.  
Departure requires no justification.

If these conditions are violated, the appropriate response is disengagement—not enforcement.

This covenant exists to protect both participants and the integrity of the protocol itself.
